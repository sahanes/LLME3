## A Note on How AIM Does Assignments:

How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment will be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts used in transformers.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

You are expected to complete all of the activities in your selected notebook!

## Assignment

The assignment for Session 2: The Transformer is straightforward: Work through the notebook, answer all questions and complete all activities!

Below are the links to the Colab Notebooks (this will require GPUs with at least 40GB of GPU Memory) - though you can use the local notebooks if you have access to the same capacity hardware.

> NOTE: You can reduce the training batchsize to 1 or 8, and reduce the number of epochs correspondingly (due to increased training time) to run on reduced hardware capacity. 

- [Standard Assignment](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gdzYi9PUqZnc80z3M_omIsLOpQ254xtu?usp=sharing): Complete the notebook, including all ❓Questions. 
- [Hardmode Assignment](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CInxjTSpqG5dSgg234TrYge9XSCshyQN?usp=sharing): Complete the notebook, including all 🏗️ Activities, and ❓Questions.
